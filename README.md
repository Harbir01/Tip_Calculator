 # Tip_Calculator

 Hello Everyone,

 Welcome to my Tip Calculator Repo where you have access to my very first project. I have created this tip calculator as one of my projects for Justice Through Code. I enrolled in JTC about a month ago, and I look forward to delivering more fun, cool and useful tools such as this one. Working on this project has shown me that if I put in the hard work, time, and effort good things are possible. 

 I would also like to take this time to say IF I CAN DO IT, SO CAN YOU!
 
 I really enjoyed working on this assignment, it helped me review all the previous assignments and knowledge I have gained. It has helped me see how I can use code to create something that can help solve problems for others.

 Although I could have made this calculator with less lines of code or a lot simplier. I wanted to apply all of the concepts I have learned. 
 
 Originally I started out by making variables for each of the user inputs I needed to capture inorder to get the calculations I needed. Then I set up confirmation print statements to make sure the user had inputed correctly. Lastly was to run the algebra and math calculations and output everything in a neatly organized manner for the user to read.

 I decided to make things more complex by adding each of the user inputs and calculations inside functions. I also incorporated exception handling so the program could catch this and fix it with the user. 

 Please feel free to use my code 
 Please provide me some feedback and advice so that I can improve.
 Thank you
